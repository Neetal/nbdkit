* Listen on specific interfaces or protocols (eg. only IPv6).

* Can scripting language plugins be installed in the plugindir?

  If a script called nbdkit-foo-plugin is installed in the
  scripting directory and the script starts with:

     #!/usr/bin/nbdkit perl

   then we could allow:

     nbdkit foo [args]

    to run the script from the plugin dir, resulting in the
    script running as above.

* syslog? journal?

* Performance - measure and improve it.

* Bash tab completion.

* filters: It should be possible to layer filters over plugins to
  do things like injecting errors and adding delays (see wdelay/rdelay
  options in the file plugin).

* Factor out the nbd client in the nbd plugin and make it available
  to other consumers, so that nbdkit can be layered.

* Suggestions for plugins to be written:

  - glance

  - cinder

  - OVA files

  - XVA files

    is a partial solution but it needs cleaning up.

  - libssh

  - libnfs

  - iscsi

  - gluster
