* Listen on specific interfaces or protocols (eg. only IPv6).

* Can we do language bindings using #!'s?
  You would enter:
    nbdkit foo [args]
  where nbdkit-foo-plugin is a Perl script starting:
    #!perl
  which causes nbdkit to load the perl plugin wrapper.

* syslog? journal?

* Glance and/or cinder plugins.

* Performance - measure and improve it.

* Implement true parallel request handling.  Currently
  NBDKIT_THREAD_MODEL_SERIALIZE_REQUESTS and
  NBDKIT_THREAD_MODEL_PARALLEL are the same, because we handle
  requests within each connection synchronously one at a time.  We
  could (and should) be able to handle them in parallel by having
  another thread pool for requests.
