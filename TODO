* Listen on specific interfaces or protocols (eg. only IPv6).

* Can we run scripting language plugins using shebangs?
  nbdkit-foo-plugin is an executable script that starts with
    #!/usr/bin/nbdkit --script=perl
  Running this causes this command to run:
    /usr/bin/nbdkit --script=perl /path/to/script [other args]

* Can scripting language plugins be installed in the plugindir?
  You would enter:
    nbdkit foo [args]
  where nbdkit-foo-plugin would be a script.  If it
  started with:
    #!/usr/bin/nbdkit --script=perl
  that would cause nbdkit to load
    nbdkit --script=perl /path/to/nbdkit-foo-plugin [args]

* syslog? journal?

* Performance - measure and improve it.

* Bash tab completion.

* filters: It should be possible to layer filters over plugins to
  do things like injecting errors and adding delays (see wdelay/rdelay
  options in the file plugin).

* Factor out the nbd client in the nbd plugin and make it available
  to other consumers, so that nbdkit can be layered.

* Suggestions for plugins to be written:

  - glance

  - cinder

  - OVA files

  - XVA files

    is a partial solution but it needs cleaning up.

  - libssh

  - libnfs

  - iscsi

  - gluster

  - ceph/rbd
