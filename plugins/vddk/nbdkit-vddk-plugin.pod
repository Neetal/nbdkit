=head1 NAME

nbdkit-vddk-plugin - VMware VDDK plugin for nbdkit

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 nbdkit vddk file=FILENAME

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<nbdkit-vddk-plugin> is a L<nbdkit(1)> plugin that serves files from
VMware VMDK and other sources by using VMware's proprietary VDDK
library.

Currently it can only serve local VMDK files.  The required
C<file=FILENAME> parameter should point to a VMDK file.  It would be
relatively simple to extend this plugin to access ESX servers or
Virtual Center.

The plugin can serve read-only (if the I<-r> option is used) or
read/write.

=head1 LIBRARY LOCATION

If the VDDK library (C<libvixDiskLib.so>) is located on a non-standard
path, you may need to set C<LD_LIBRARY_PATH> or modify
C</etc/ld.so.conf> before this plugin will work.

The VDDK library may depend on C<libexpat.so.0> which you may have to
install yourself.

=head1 PARAMETERS

=over 4

=item B<config=FILENAME>

This optional parameter lets you specify the name of the VDDK
configuration file.

=item B<file=FILENAME>

Set the name of the VMDK file to serve.  This parameter is required.

=item B<libdir=PATHNAME>

This sets the path of the VMware VDDK library.  It must be an
absolute path.

If the parameter is not given, then a hard-coded path determined at
compile time is used.
