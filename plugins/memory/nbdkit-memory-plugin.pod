=head1 NAME

nbdkit-memory-plugin - nbdkit virtual memory plugin

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 nbdkit memory size=SIZE

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<nbdkit-memory-plugin> is a plugin for L<nbdkit(1)> which stores a
single disk image in virtual memory, and discards it when nbdkit
exits.

All nbdkit clients will see the same disk content, initially all
zeroes.

The disk image is stored in memory using a sparse array.  The
allocated parts of the disk image cannot be larger than physical RAM
plus swap, less whatever is being used by the rest of the system.  If
you want to allocate more space than this use L<nbdkit-file-plugin(1)>
backed by a temporary file instead.

However the virtual size can be as large as you like, up to the
maximum supported by nbdkit (C<2⁶³-1> bytes).  This limit is tested
when nbdkit is compiled, and it should work on all platforms and
architectures supported by nbdkit.

This can be used for testing where you don't care about the final
content of the disk image.
