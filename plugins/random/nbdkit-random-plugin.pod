nbdkit-random-plugin - plugin to serve random data

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 nbdkit random size=SIZE [seed=SEED]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<nbdkit-random-plugin> is a plugin for L<nbdkit(1)> which serves
random data, read only.

The size of the virtual disk must be specified using the C<size>
parameter.  If you specify the C<seed> parameter then you will get the
same random data over multiple runs with the same seed.

The random data is generated using an I<in>secure method (a Linear
Congruential Generator).  This plugin is mainly good for testing NBD
clients.

=item B<size=SIZE>

Specify the virtual size of the disk image.

This parameter is required.

=item B<seed=SEED>

If not specified then a random seed is chosen.
