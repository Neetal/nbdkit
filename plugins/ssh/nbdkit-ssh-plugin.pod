=head1 NAME

nbdkit-ssh-plugin - access disk images over the SSH protocol

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 nbdkit ssh host=HOST path=PATH
            [port=PORT] [user=USER] [password=PASSWORD|-|+FILENAME]
            [config=CONFIG_FILE]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is an L<nbdkit(1)> plugin which lets you access remote disk
images over Secure Shell (SSH).  Any server which hosts disk images
and runs an SSH server can be turned into an NBD source using this
plugin.

=head2 EXAMPLES

=over 4

=item nbdkit ssh host=ssh.example.com path=disk.img

Open a file called F<disk.img> on remote host C<ssh.example.com>.
Because the pathname is relative, it is opened relative to the user’s
home directory on the remote server.

The remote file can be read or written.  To force read-only access add
the I<-r> flag.

=item nbdkit ssh host=ssh.example.com path=disk.img user=bob

As above but log in using username C<bob> (instead of trying the local
username).

=head1 PARAMETERS

=over 4

=item B<config=>CONFIG_FILE

Read local SSH configuration from an alternate configuration file.

=item B<config=>

Do not read any local SSH configuration.

The C<config> parameter is optional.  If not specified then
F<~/.ssh/config> is read.

=item B<host=>HOST

Specify the name or IP address of the remote host.

This parameter is required.

=item B<password=>PASSWORD

Set the password to use when connecting to the remote server.

Note that passing this on the command line is not secure on shared
machines.

=item B<password=->

Ask for the password (interactively) when nbdkit starts up.

=item B<password=+>FILENAME

Read the password from the named file.  This is the most secure method
to supply a password, as long as you set the permissions on the file
appropriately.

=item B<path=>PATH

Specify the path to the remote file.  This can be a relative path in
which case it is relative to the remote home directory.

This parameter is required.

=item B<port=>PORT

Specify the SSH protocol port name or number.

This parameter is optional.  If not given then the default ssh port is
used.

=item B<user=>USER

Specify the remote username.

This parameter is optional.  If not given then the local username is
used.

=head1 NOTES

=head2 Known hosts

The SSH server’s host key is checked at connection time, and must be
present and correct in the local "known hosts" file (usually
F<~/.ssh/known_hosts>).  If you have never connected to the SSH server
before then the connection will usually fail.  You may have to connect
to the server first using L<ssh(1)> so you can manually accept the
host key.

=head2 Supported authentication methods

This plugin supports only the following authentication methods:
C<none>, C<publickey> or C<password>.  In particular note that
C<keyboard-interactive> is I<not> supported.

=head2 SSH agent

There is no means for nbdkit to ask for the public key passphrase when
it is running as a server.  Therefore C<publickey> authentication must
be done in conjunction with L<ssh-agent(1)>.

=head1 FILES

=over 4

=item F<~/.ssh/config>

This is the default local SSH config file which is read to get other
options.  You can change this using the C<config> option.
