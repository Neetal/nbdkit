A guide to benchmarking nbdkit
==============================


General comments
----------------

* The plugin matters!  Different plugins have completely different
  uses, implementations and threading models.  There is little point
  in talking about "the performance of nbdkit" without mentioning what
  plugin you are testing.

* The client matters!  Does the client support multi-conn?  Does the
  client use the oldstyle or newstyle protocol?  Has the client been
  written with performance in mind?  The currently best clients are
  (a) the Linux kernel (nbd.ko) (b) qemu.  Make sure you are using
  recent versions and have multi-conn enabled.

* Filters affect performance.  When benchmarking you should never use
  filters unless filters are what you are trying to benchmark.


Testing using Linux kernel client and fio
-----------------------------------------

(1) Install Jens Axboe's fio (Flexible I/O tester)

https://github.com/axboe/fio

(2) Create the fio configuation file:

Create /var/tmp/test.fio containing:

----------------------------------------------------------------------
[test]
rw=randrw
size=64m
directory=/var/tmp/nbd
ioengine=libaio
iodepth=4
direct=1
numjobs=8
group_reporting
time_based
runtime=120
----------------------------------------------------------------------

(3) Run nbdkit.

From the nbdkit source directory:

rm /tmp/sock
./nbdkit -f -U /tmp/sock memory 1G

(4) Loop mount the NBD server:

modprobe nbd
nbd-client -C 8 -b 512 -unix /tmp/sock /dev/nbd0
mkfs.xfs -f /dev/nbd0
mkdir /var/tmp/nbd
mount /dev/nbd0 /var/tmp/nbd

(5) Run the fio test:

fio /var/tmp/test.fio


Variations
----------

* Try turning multi-conn on or off or adjusting the number of
  connections.  See the nbd-client -C option.

* Try adjusting the number of fio threads.

* Run nbdkit under perf:

  perf record -a -g --call-graph=dwarf -- \
      server/nbdkit  -f -U /tmp/sock \
          ./plugins/memory/.libs/nbdkit-memory-plugin.so 1G

* Use other plugins.  nbdkit-file-plugin is an important one to test.
  It might also be worth devising a test using a readonly plugin.


Future work
-----------

* Write an NBD I/O engine for fio.
