=head1 NAME

nbdkit-noextents-filter - disable extents in the underlying plugin

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 nbdkit --filter=noextents plugin

=head1 DESCRIPTION

“Extents” are a feature of the NBD protocol / nbdkit which allow the
client to detect sparse regions of the underlying disk.
C<nbdkit-noextents-filter> disables this so that the plugin appears to
be fully allocated.

This filter can be useful when combined with L<nbdkit-file-plugin(1)>
serving a file from a file system known to have poor C<lseek(2)>
performance (C<tmpfs> is known to be one such system).

=head1 PARAMETERS

There are no parameters specific to nbdkit-noextents-filter.  Any
parameters are passed through to and processed by the underlying
plugin in the normal way.
